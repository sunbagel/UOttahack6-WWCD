### Inspiration
Restaurants play an important role in serving society through high-quality meals that we otherwise would not have time to prepare ourselves. To maintain this level of quality, however, ingredients must be fresh every day. Subsequently, this means a lot of food waste. Millions of pounds of leftover ingredients and pre-made dishes are sent to the landfill every day. At the same time, millions of people struggle to find their next meal every day. We wanted to develop software that could help bridge this gap and reallocate resources into the hands of people who need it

### What it does
Chicken Dinner is the platform we developed to serve as a bridge, connecting restaurants, grocery stores, and households with surplus food to soup kitchens and food banks in need. By leveraging real-time technology and a user-friendly interface, Chicken Dinner facilitates the donation of excess food, ensuring that it reaches those who can benefit from it most, rather than going to waste.
